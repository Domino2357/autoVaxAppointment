# autoVaxAppointment

## Purpose
This little script is an inspiration to automate the laborious appointment-making-process for vaccinations against COVID19 in Germany. It should work fine for the Bundesland "Niedersachsen". For other region outside Niedersachsen you will need a different code since every Bundesland seems to have its own website.

## Prerequisits
First, you need to install python on your machine. Here is a reference on how to do that on a Windows machine: https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/ here is one for mac https://www.dummies.com/programming/python/how-to-install-python-on-a-mac/. If you use Linux, I don't think you'll need an explaination on how to install python.
